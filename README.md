## iOS Reader App â€“ Product Viewer

###  Project Description

This iOS application is developed using *UIKit*. It fetches and displays a list of products from a public REST API:
"https://dummyjson.com/products"

The app allows users to *view products, **search by product name, and **refresh the product list* manually. It is designed using clean coding principles and structured architecture for scalability and maintenance.

---

### Architecture

The app follows the *MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)* architecture:

* *Model* handles the data structure (Product).
* *ViewModel* manages business logic and prepares data for display.
* *View/Controller* handles user interface and binds data using UIKit.
* The code is cleanly separated into layers like *Networking, **Repository, and **ViewModel* to maintain clarity and reusability.
